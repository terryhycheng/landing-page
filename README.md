## 1. Project Description

This project was built on the temaplate 'Landing Page Project' provided by Udacity school.

At first, the project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the page. I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one by adding functionalities to the JavaScript file `js/app.js`. I also made some changes on `css/styles.css` to fit the elements better on the provided layout.

The main mission of this project is to create an interactive navigation bar which enables users to travel through the entire page smoothly by simply clicking the buttons in it.

## 2. Usage

### 2.1 Modifying Title

When you modify the **h2** elements in `index.html`, the buttons in navigation bar will be automatically updated accordingly.

### 2.2 Adding New Section

When you need to add an extra section, please make sure the **_id_** of **_section_** tag follow the format like 'section5'.

## 3. Dependencies

This project was created with only HTML5, CSS 3 and JavaScript(ES2015/ES6). No extra dependencies were used.
